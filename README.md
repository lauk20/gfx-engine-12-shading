## New Graphics Engine Features
1. Gouraud Shading
- Use command ```shading gouraud``` to use Gouraud shading. Default shading is flat shading.
2. Phong Shading
- Use command ```shading phong``` to use Phong shading. Default shading is flat shading.
3. .obj Reader
- Use command like so: ```mesh constant : teapot.obj```, replacing constant with any color constants and teapot.obj with any .obj file.

## The Details
I will be working in Python:
1. Implement Gouraud Shading
2. Implement Phong Shading
3. Make animation work in Python if needed (since worked in C for animation assignment)
